# WellD Pattern Recognition

# Why and How
Computer vision involves analyzing patterns in visual images and reconstructing the real world objects that
produced them. The process in often broken up into two phases: feature detection and pattern recognition.
Feature detection involves selecting important features of the image; pattern recognition involves
discovering patterns in the features. We will investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem
involving points and line segments. This kind of pattern recognition arises in many other applications, for
example statistical data analysis.
So I decided to embrace this challenge and tried to solve the problem from a mathematical point of view.

# Requirements
1. Java JDK greater or equal 1.8
2. A lot of patience

# Implementation
The implementation is based on few assumptions:
1. A line segment is represented in the form y = mx + q
2. A point is unique in a space set
3. A point p is on a line l if it has the same line equation of another pair of points q and k

# Things to improve
1. Documentation and Swagger generation
2. API Exception handling
3. Unit testing
